# 3tpd-cheap-bodies

Sex tourism is all about inequality â€“ the inequality in economic power of a client and a prostitute; the inequality leading people to prostitution; the inequality in price a client pays for a body of a prostitute and a prostitute risks to pay for selling her/his body. 

The upcoming Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro increase the risk of prostitution, including children, in the country, which already is a leading world destination for sex tourism.

I propose interactive data visualisation that will explore the multiple faces of inequality in sex tourism. This could be widely used by global media covering the Olympic Games as well as by governments and those in tourist industry who wish to dissuade travellers from the temptations of cheap sex.
